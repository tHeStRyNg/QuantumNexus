Then, you can create a .env file with the following.

```
ALCHEMY_POLYGON_RPC_URL='<your-own-alchemy-polygon-mainnet-rpc-url>'
```

#### Add your Private Key

If you want to execute flashloan on the polygon mainnet, you need to add your `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable, [with a private key from your wallet](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).

```
PRIVATE_KEY='your-PRIVATE_KEY'
```

\*Note: If using metamask, you'll have to add a `0x` to the start of your private key)
